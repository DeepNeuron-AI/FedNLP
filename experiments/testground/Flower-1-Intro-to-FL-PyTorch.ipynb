Each instance of `FlowerClient` represents a *single client* in our federated learning system. Federated learning systems have multiple clients (otherwise there's not much to federate), so each client will be represented by its own instance of `FlowerClient`. If we have, for example, three clients in our workload, then we'd have three instances of `FlowerClient`. Flower calls `FlowerClient.fit` on the respective instance when the server selects a particular client for training (and `FlowerClient.evaluate` for evaluation).\n",

Flower calls `client_fn` whenever it needs an instance of one particular client to call `fit` or `evaluate` (those instances are usually discarded after use, so they should not keep any local state).
